### group all custom styles in CSS files (currently custom styles are directly in the html code)

### fix the show/hide effect of the buttons in the sheet view

### manage properly the file upload functionality (load .pdf file, convert each page in
    a single image, create a new folder inside "media", etc...)

### new sheet form: the "input" area is not extended to the entire "ADD" button

### new sheet form: the advisor that shows up when typing the title is quite annoying
